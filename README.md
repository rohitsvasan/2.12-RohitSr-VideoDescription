1: Things that can impact dead reckoning navigational accuracy are the direction the SVD is facing when you are trying to make it move, the degrees that the SVD motors are supposed to rotate, and the velocity of the SVD.
You can compensate for it by reducing the torque and velocity of the SVD and its motors, and altering the amount of degrees the motors are supposed to rotate when going forward and taking turns, so that the transitions are smooth and the SVD is able to move properly.
3: Dead reckoning navigation can be beneficial when programming a self-driving vehicle because other navigation methods are too complicated and can easily be influenced by other factors which can cause the code to glitch. They provide a good way of estimating the distance that a vehicle has traveled in situations where not as much technology is available.
4: -Some challenges are positioning the vehicle in the exactly right direction, and determining the necessary degree for rotation to get the vehicle to move forward or take turns.
  -Abstractions manage complexity in a program by only showing the code and data the user needs to see for the project, and leaving other things such as specific numbers and calculations out for simplicity purposes.
